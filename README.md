# Biocrates QC explore
Setting:
A database with little over 110700 entries that encompass 114 batches of data generated on a mass spectrometer.
Each batch contains several quality controls (QCs) and the bad QCs have been identified. 

This shiny app explores the question: are there batches with higher or lower number of bad QCs compared to the whole lot.
Both the Graph and the top Table are responsive along with the user controls on the left side.
